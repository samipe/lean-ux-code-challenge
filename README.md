# Lean UX Code Challenge
## Task
The given task is to create a website with functionalities showcased in the provided video. You can choose any technical stack you prefer. The chosen stack is not a criteria for evaluation, but be prepared to explain and discuss about your choices. Please use the hotels.json and images provided in the assets-directory. You may change the syntax or filename of the file, but do not alter any keys or values. Consider the file as a mock API. The expected time to complete the task is 1-3 working days.
## How to return the project
Your application can be returned as a functioning hosted website, as a Git repository, or as static files. In case you return it as a hosted website, be sure to also provide the source code. If you only return the source files, the project must have a readme-file that explains how to open or start it. When you are done, send the submission to your contact person at Siili.
